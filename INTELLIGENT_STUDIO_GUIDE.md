## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Phase 1: Business Onboarding (One-Time Setup)**

**Location:** Intelligent Studio → Setup Tab

The AI asks 7-10 conversational questions to build your business profile:

```
Example Conversation:

AI: "What industry or niche is your business in?"
You: "SaaS project management tools"

AI: "Who is your primary target audience?"
You: "Small business owners and startup founders"

AI: "How would you describe your brand voice?"
You: "Professional but friendly, approachable"

AI: "What are your main business goals?"
You: "Increase brand awareness, generate leads, drive signups"

AI: "Who are your main competitors?"
You: "Asana, Trello, Monday.com"

AI: "What makes you unique compared to competitors?"
You: "Simpler interface, better pricing, built for small teams"

AI: "What tone should your content have?"
You: "Conversational, helpful, occasionally humorous"
```

**Result:** Complete business profile saved and used for all future content generation.
